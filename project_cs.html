			<p>During my six-week internship at Proto-Lab in HCII Carnegie Mellon University,</br> I participated in the ConsensUs project to build a group decision-making web application</br> under the guidance of Prof. Steven Dow. </p>
			<p>I was regarded as the best coder and designer in the entire process</br> from competitive analysis, prototyping to UI design and fully development</br> when I contributed 90% of the code. </p>

			<h3>prototyping</h3>
			<p>Itâ€™s not an easy thing to reach a consensus among a group of people,</br> such as, to decide where to live in a new city for our whole family,</br> or, to choose a destination for Chrismas holiday. </p>
			<p>So we try to solve this problem by construction a decision matrix.</p>
			<p>The first prototyping version was created by Google Sheet.</br> Every participant can evaluate different mensions for the decision.</br> They can also set the weight for each factor. </br>The result page will show the average of the score, </br>so as to help the group to make a decision.</p>

			<p>1</br>The group discuss different options and factors that affect their decisions</br> through the chatroom on the left.</br> Options and factors can be changed at any time.</br> The chatroom will also be available throughout the process.</p>
			<p>2</br>Every participant can weigh the factors according to their own preferences. </br>They can then give a score for each factor in the evaluation matrix for each option. </br>The total score for each option is calculated automatically.</p>
			<p>3</br>During the evaluation, participants can comment below each cell. </br>The comments can provide supplementary information</br> to help the participants score and give participants a chance</br> to voice their personal opinions.</p>
			<p>4</br>The report page will display the final rankings and scores.</br> The darker colors indicate higher rankings.</br> The cells will also be colored </br>if a factor contains a higher score difference. </br>Participants can then use these information to further discuss and reach a consensus.</p>
