                        <p>The Clough Undergraduate Learning Center (CULC) is a popular study destination for students in Georgia Tech. The CULC Pal is designed as a kiosk placed in the CULC to assist students who choose to study there find an available spot to work in a shortest amount of time.</p>
                        <p>As the first semester-long project in HCI @ GaTech, this project equiped me with experience of user research, ideation, UX design and all the way to prototyping. As the only developer, I built an <a href="http://qiaochumu.com/kiwiculc" target="_blank">interactive web prototype</a> using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. </p>

                    <p> The project began when my team were just newbies at Georgia Tech. It didn't take long when we found that a building called CULC ( the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons ) is the most popular study destination for students with its central location and variety of resourses. </p>
                    <p> But we always heard complaints (and had them too). A common challenge for students is finding available seating in the CULC that fits each student’s needs and requirements. This challenge can be even more frustrating during certain times of the day or year, when the CULC is crowded. Therefore, we decided to discover how to <b>prevent students from wasting precious study or work time by searching for a location that meets their needs</b>.</p>
<!--                    <p><img src="img/culc_image.png"></p>-->
                    <p>The research process began with <b>#Observations</b> and <b >#Contextual-Inquiries</b> in the target space to study how students use the space and resources within it. We conducted <b > #Semi-structured Interviews </b> and <b>#Hierachy Task Analysis</b> to understand the thought process of our target users in how they find a seat. We created behavioral <b>#Personas / Composite Character Profiles</b> based on the interviews rather than traditional personas. Behavioral personas tell us what our users do and how well they work with the current system to find a studying spot.</p>
                    <p>Through the user research process, we were able to target the pain points.</p>

                        <li><b>However, Students have difficulty looking for a spot </b>especially at certain periods like weekday evenings, dead week, days before a break.</li>

                        <li><b>Students have their own process of choosing a studying spot. </b>Some of them just go with the first spot that they see. Some of them will always check their favorite spots and see whether they are taken. </li>

                        <li><b>Students have their own requirements when choosing a studying spot. </b> CULC current provides all kinds of studying spot for students. Among them, plugs are the most frequently required facilities.</li>

                        <li><b>Some students would like to study with others so they can discuss problems in the CULC. </b> Some students mentioned that they wanted to meet other students who could discuss the problems of a course together with.

                    We also conducted the evaluation of all the dimensions of the three alternatives, including feasibility, cost of money, time investment, usability, interaction, cognition, and creativity. Taking the features and constraints of each interesting idea, we picked out the kiosk idea and continue to prototyping and development. </p>

                    <p>In order for a kiosk user interface to be “touch-friendly,” it must allow users to navigate comfortably using only their fingers without the need for a mouse and keyboard. These principles are concluded from investigating existing kiosks and articles. </p>
                        
                    <div class="container-fluid pic-container p2p">

</b></p>
                                   <p>The kiosk is not supposed to engage users when they complete a task. Besides, users also tend to not read blocks of text very closely, so icons, pictures, sounds, and animations are important.</p>

                                <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-5">

                                    <p>A cluttered kiosk user interface will distract the user from completing their tasks.  So in our design, the designer avoids soliciting the user for too much information on a single screen.

                    As <b>the only developer</b>, I developed the interactive web prototype using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.</p>
                <p>
                    The functional prototype was developed as a responsive webpage. The floor map are represented by <b>inline SVGs</b>, created in Sketch. <b>CSS attributes</b> were applied for <b>transitions</b> that will rotate and move the floors. The ‘up’ and ’down’ buttons enable the user to navigate upstairs or downstairs through the different floors of the CULC. The “stack” button leads the user to the overview page, which shows all the floors in the building. The pins were also initially SVGs with the same dimensions of each floor. Clicking on a pin will open the details for that common space.
                    The <b>interactions</b> are implemented using JavaScript, including <b>Event-listener</b> to all the pins. </p>

                <p>The objective of our evaluation is to find out how well users understand the visualization,  whether the users get the information they need. And basically whether our installation would help them find spots to study successfully.</p>

                <p>Our <b>Heuristic evaluation</b> was on the final presentation of the course. More than 20 experts made their comments on the design. They evaluated our design by referring to some common heuristics with a focus on usability, understandability, learnability of the system.</p>
                <p>Here are the iteration directions we gathered based on the feedback. </p>
                  <ul class="findings ">
                      <li><b>"You are Here" needed</b>: A pin showing the current position of the kiosk would aid users perceive the direction and geographic location.</li>

<li><b>Real-time Photos</b>: The pictures of the common areas should be in real-time, so that the crowdedness conveyed by the photo could be consistent with the number of empty seats shown beside the photos. Users feel confused when the actual space and the shown photo are not consistent, because the photo remains the same all the time.</li>

<li><b>Legend needed</b>: A legend showing the color decoding should be placed in the visualization, helping users understand the 'heatmap' concept.</li>

<li><b>Unclickable icons and pins</b>: In the detailed view of the floor plans, only the pins for study commons areas were clickable. What's more, unclickable icons are used to express available resources in the detailed content of each common area. During the evaluation, many users tried to click those pins and icons. Therefore, we reconsidered the UI design of the pins for navigation and for resources.</li>
