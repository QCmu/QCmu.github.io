			<p>My first project related to HCI made me realize the importance of interpretation in UX research. </p> 
			<p>We expected to explore the effect of exercise on the subjective well-being of </br> Chinese females from two aspects, namely, social network and wearable devices. </p> 
			<p>I was mainly responsible for data collection and analysis because of my statistics background.</p>

			<h3>introduction</h3>
			<p>Firstly, in the context of exercise, we explored the
effects of online social network and wearable devices in the enhancement of</br>
Chinese females’ subjective well-being. </br>An in-situ 2*2 experiment design was
conducted.</br> Result showed that online social network was significantly related
to positive affects. </br>Wearable devices didn’t show significance due to problems
of accessibility. </p>
			<p>Secondly, this study explored the potential linguistic variables</br>
that could predict Chinese females’ emotional well-being according to
exercise-based online tweets. </br>Regression model was applied to explore the
relation between potential variables and participants’ self-reported emotional
states. </br>Positive additional activities and number of likes were two important
variables that could be referred for further analysis. </p>

			<h3>analysis</h3>
			
			<p>I was mainly responsible for data collection and analysis because of my statistics background. </p>
			<p>Through regression model and ANOVA, I successfully identified potential linguistic variables,</br> such as emoticons and pictures, which could predict emotional well-being of users. </p>

			<p>The paper was accepted by HCI International (HCII) 2015 and was published as a chapter in the book Cross-Cultural Design Applications.  </p>
