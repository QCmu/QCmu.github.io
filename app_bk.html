			<p>Armed with previous experiences, I challenged myself </br>by participating in an APP design competition and won the Best Design award. </p>
			<p>Competing with mature teams with startup experience, </br>my team was required to complete the entire process </br>from idea creation to product implementation in one month.  </p>

			<h3>function</h3>
			<p>Detecting or estimating the weight of food</br> to control daily calorie was extremely difficult </br>because of my own weight loss experience.</p>
			<p> Hence, I proposed to obtain a fat loss assistant</br> connected to a portable Bluetooth scale to record calorie intake </br>and the Apple watch to record calorie consumption as our product. </p>

			<h3>design</h3>
			<p>After recognizing that superior design logic should reduce unnecessary interaction, </br>I attempted to incorporate this idea into my application.</br> For example, </br>the application would recommend detailed diet menu according to the calorie plan to users </br>as soon as they record their meal. </p>

			<h3>development</h3>
			<p>Apart from completing market research and UI design independently,</br> I developed interaction animation and front-end part with objective-c language. </p>
			<p>This experience allowed me to enjoy the sense of creating a practical application that can turn complex steps into a simple behavior through HCI.</p>
